# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you keep track of changes. This folder should
be committed to your repository.

## What are Changesets?

A changeset is a file that contains information about a change that should be applied to packages when
releasing. It contains three parts:

1. **Version change type** (following semver, and can be `major`, `minor` or `patch`)
2. **A summary of the change** - this is what will be included in the changelog
3. **Change information** - this is metadata used by changesets, primarily to know which packages
   need to be released

## How to use Changesets

### Adding a Changeset

When you want to make a change, you should add a changeset by running:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

This will prompt you with the following:

1. **What kind of change is this?** - You'll be asked to select the type of change (major, minor, or patch)
2. **Which packages should be included?** - For this single-package repo, it will automatically select the package
3. **Write a summary** - A brief description of the change that will appear in the changelog

This will create a new markdown file in the `.changeset` folder with a random name. This file should be
committed alongside your code changes.

### Releasing

When you're ready to release, you need to:

1. **Version the changes** - This will update the version in `package.json` and `manifest.json`, and create/update the `CHANGELOG.md`:
   ```bash
   npm run version
   ```
   This command will:
   - Read all changesets
   - Update package.json version
   - Update manifest.json version
   - Update versions.json
   - Create/update CHANGELOG.md
   - Delete used changesets

2. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: version bump"
   git push
   ```

3. **Create a release** (if using GitHub):
   - Create a new release on GitHub with the new version tag
   - The changelog will be automatically included

### Checking Changeset Status

To see what changesets are pending:

```bash
npm run changeset:status
```

## Workflow Example

1. Make your code changes
2. Add a changeset: `npm run changeset`
3. Commit your changes including the changeset file
4. When ready to release: `npm run version`
5. Commit the version bump: `git add . && git commit -m "chore: version bump" && git push`
6. Create a GitHub release with the new version tag
